  <h2 class="content-block" id="rainfall">Rainfall and Streamflow</h2>
  <p class="bc-small">
  The average annual rainfall for the period October 1979 through September 1996 measured by Roy Farrington Jones on Olive Avenue in Ross was 49.33 inches. The lowest rainfall during that period was 28.29 inches in water year 1990 (October 1989 through September 1990) and the highest, 90.75 inches during water year 1983. 
  Average annual rainfall at the Marin Water gauge at Lake Lagunitas for the period 1875 to 2024 was 52.65 inches. Although this gauge is not within the watershed, it is representative of rainfall in Kentfield, Ross, and San Anselmo. The lowest value during that period was 19.70 inches for water year 1924; the highest, 112.15 inches for water year 1890.   </p>

  Between 1951 and 1993, the U.S. Geological Survey maintained a stream gage just upstream of the Lagunitas Road Bridge in Ross. Since 1993, the Marin County Department of Public Works has gathered data at the gage. Between 1951 and 2024, the lowest flows occurred July through September 1977 when the stream was dry. The highest flows occurred in early January 1982, when the peak flow within the channel was 6000 cubic feet per second.   </p>

  <h2 class="content-block" id="flooding">Flooding</h2>
  <p class="bc-small">
  Between 1914 and 1960 there were twelve damaging floods of the valley 
  floor or about one flood every four years. Since 1960 damaging floods 
  have occurred less frequently for several reasons, including better creek 
  maintenance, construction of a concrete channel in Kentfield and Ross, and 
  the fact that 14 out of the 38 years were relatively dry with rainfall between 
  42% and 75% of the average. Even so, the largest and third largest floods of 
  record occurred during this time, in January 1982 and March 1983. The flood of 
  January 3–5, 1982 was the largest on record and caused considerable damage in 
  San Anselmo, Ross, Kentfield, and Larkspur. Flood water 4 to 5 feet deep flowed
   down Poplar and Kent avenues with enough force to move cars. On February 2, 1998, 
   just as water began to come out of the channel at the Lagunitas Road bridge and at
    Granton Park, the rain eased up and the water level dropped. A flood on December 31, 2005 
    reached levels only slightly below those of the 1982 flood, and spurred town and county 
    officials to initiate an ambitious program to reduce future flooding.    </p>
