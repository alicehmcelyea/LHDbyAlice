                Creek Protection
              </h2>
              <p class="bc-small">
                Creek setbacks are generally considered important for
                maintaining the natural functions of creeks in developed areas.
                These functions include serving as wildlife corridors, providing
                habitat for fish such as the threatened steelhead, allowing for
                lateral movement, filtering out pollutants through riparian
                vegetation on sloping creek banks or marsh vegetation on level
                shorelines, and conveying flood waters. Natural creeks also have
                recognized esthetic value and a cooling effect for nearby
                homeowners. 
                <br /><br />
                Regardless of their value, our creeks and their environs
                continue to be degraded by structures and paving that are
                constructed too close to the channel and by the armoring of
                creek banks to protect these structures. Armored banks lead to
                narrower channels, faster flowing floodwaters, additional
                erosion of creek banks both upstream and downstream, and further
                armoring. Destruction of native vegetation and water diversions
                also degrade the riparian corridor. All this destroys the very
                things we value about our creeks—and may result in bringing
                about what San Anselmo and Fairfax prevented the Army Corps from
                achieving in the 1970s: the substantial channelization of San
                Anselmo, Fairfax, and Sleepy Hollow creeks.  
                <br /><br />
                Effective protection measures should be incorporated in local
                codes to apply to alterations within the creek channels and
                improvements on property adjacent to the creeks. An ordinance
                would have to be flexible enough to fit the varied conditions of
                lots within the town, while not allowing so many exceptions that
                it is useless. Marin County has been working on a Stream
                Conservation Ordinance for decades but because of property owner
                resistance, has had limited success in implementing it. 
                <br /><br />
                We urge local jurisdictions to draft riparian corridor
                protection plans, implemented by ordinances, to control
                development on properties in the vicinity of our creeks, and to
                ensure that when development occurs, riparian habitat is
                simultaneously improved.

                Recommendations for Creek Corridor Management Plans and Creek
                Protection Policies and Ordinances
              </h2>
              <ul class="bc-small">
                <li>
                  Friends of Corte Madera Creek Watershed makes the following
                  recommendations for creek corridor management plans and creek
                  protection policies and ordinances: 
                </li>

                <li>
                  Natural features and functions of a creek corridor should be
                  protected. These include: sloping banks; native vegetation; a
                  riparian zone capable of filtering out pollutants (especially
                  sediment); wildlife habitat and passage; aquatic life; a
                  degree of meandering of the stream; esthetic value; bank cover
                  to reduce erosion; and roughness of banks to attenuate flood
                  waters.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The California Code of Regulations Title 14, Section 1.72
                  defines a stream, creek or river as “a body of water that
                  flows at least periodically or intermittently through a bed or
                  channel having banks and supports fish or other aquatic life.
                  This includes watercourses having a surface or subsurface flow
                  that supports or has supported riparian vegetation.”
                </li>
                <li>
                  Designated creek corridor width should be based on the
                  potential for riparian habitat and varies from creek to creek.
                  Some definitions of creek corridor width depend on the
                  observed creek profile and character of existing vegetation at
                  a particular site. However, in a developed area, such a
                  definition ignores prior destruction of riparian vegetation
                  and the natural potential of an area. Where the designated
                  creek corridor is narrower than the setback, property owners
                  are encouraged to enhance riparian habitat in the setback.
                </li>
                 
                <li>
                  Creek setback. Setbacks are generally measured from the top of
                  the bank or from the creek centerline. The City of Oakland
                  defines the setback as being measured back from the imaginary
                  top of a 2:1 slope from the toe of the bank (i.e., a
                  26.5-degree slope), a definition that more closely
                  approximates a natural condition in alluvial soils. Such a
                  definition also avoids depending on a movable and often
                  artificial starting point; additionally, homeowners who grade
                  back the creek bank could find themselves penalized as the
                  effective setback is increased. The setback distance could
                  vary from creek to creek, as established in a management plan.
                  Development (e.g., buildings, impervious paving, swimming
                  pools) should be prohibited within the setback. Varying
                  setbacks could be established for different reaches of a creek
                  depending upon the width of the riparian corridor, and
                  potential (or lack of potential) for creek restoration.  
                </li>
                <li>
                  The term “buffer” may be used to refer to a band of lightly
                  used land between a defined creek corridor and the setback
                  distance.  
                </li>
                <li>
                  Uses that are allowed or disallowed within a designated zone
                  must be defined. Improvements such as fences, paving, decks,
                  hot tubs and ornamental plantings must be addressed.  
                </li>
                <li>
                  Design review should be required in defined circumstances.  
                </li>
                <li>
                  Variances may be permitted on improved properties, on small
                  lots, and in irremediable situations; however, most situations
                  should be addressed through the specific setback distance
                  established for each creek.  
                </li>
                <li>
                  The requirement to obtain permits from other regulatory
                  agencies should be included. These agencies may include San
                  Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board, California
                  Department of Fish and Wildlife, Army Corps of Engineers, NOAA
                  Fisheries, and the Coastal Commission.  
                </li>
                <li>
                  Any new creekside project should include a survey of the
                  riparian area and a study of the consequences of any
                  alterations to grade, vegetation, or runoff.  
                </li>
                <li>
                  Habitat enhancement should be encouraged or required as a
                  condition of a permit. New vegetation should be maintained and
                  monitored.  
                </li>
                <li>
                  Tree protection policies should consider whether a species is
                  native or not. Invasive non-native plant species such as
                  bamboo, giant reed (Arundo), ivy and periwinkle (Vinca) should
                  be prohibited from being planted within protected zones. Only
                  native riparian species should be planted within the
                  designated riparian corridor.  
                </li>
                <li>
                  Fence design should be considered, to allow for wildlife
                  passage and creek protection.  
                </li>
                <li>
                  Surface runoff must be managed to increase infiltration and
                  reduce erosion.  
                </li>
                <li>
                  Best Management Practices for creekside construction should be
                  defined.  
                </li>
                <li>
                  Biotechnical techniques of bank stabilization should be
                  required, when stabilization is necessary. Any other technique
                  used must incorporate plantings, e.g., crib walls and riprap.
                  Ideally, the bank is sloped back to a gentler grade.  
                </li>
                <li>Channel water-carrying capacity should be maintained.  </li>
                <li>Flood-plains should be enlarged where possible.  </li>
                <li>
                  Vegetation removal and trimming for flood control purposes
                  must be carried out only as each specific site requires to
                  serve the purpose, following up-to-date practices.  
                </li>
                <li>
                  Water diversions should be prohibited. Summer pools are
                  critical habitat for young steelhead. 
                </li>
