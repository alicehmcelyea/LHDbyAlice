                While the health of our creeks is very much influenced by human
                activities in the uplands of our watershed, creeks have their
                own dynamics that have a direct relationship with their
                immediate human neighbors. Thanks to the tradition that property
                boundaries generally run down the center of the creek, waterways
                are usually not bridged over or otherwise developed beyond what
                is necessary to protect real estate (or to accommodate public
                roads). The result is that creek corridors are—or have the
                potential to be—nature reserves and fish and wildlife migration
                corridors in the heart of the heavily developed valley floor.  
                <br /><br />
                There are many ways that the creeks’ natural resources and
                ecosystem functions can be protected, enhanced or restored. The
                most effective way to avoid impacts is to keep development out
                of and away from a creek. Yet in a developed watershed like
                ours, there are many options to enhance the creeks’ resources,
                if not restore them.
