                The natural communities of the watershed reflect the variety of
                local soil types, drainage patterns, elevations, slope, and
                orientations to sun and wind. The following natural communities
                are found in the watershed: Northern Coastal Scrub, Chaparral,
                Grasslands, Coastal Salt Marsh, Freshwater Marsh, Vernal Marsh
                (Seasonal Wetland), Coastal Riparian Forest, Valley Oak Woodland
                and Oak Savannah, Coast Live Oak Woodland, and Mixed Evergreen
                Forest.<br /><br />
                Several rare plant species are found in or adjacent to our
                watershed, especially where serpentine is exposed. There is
                substantial urban and suburban development within the watershed,
                so habitats in the watershed also include suburban gardens,
                urban parks and roadsides.

                Wildlife in the Watershed
              </h3>
              <p class="bc-small">
                Our watershed provides habitat to species that have adapted well
                to urban and suburban development, including mule deer, coyote,
                grey fox, raccoon, opossum, skunks, numerous birds, and a
                variety of reptiles and amphibians. Mountain lions, bears and
                river otters are occasional visitors. The federally endangered
                Ridgway’s rail and salt marsh harvest mouse and the threatened
                northern spotted owl occur in the watershed.  <br /><br />

                Over the years, sightings of adult steelhead (Oncorhynchus
                mykiss), coho salmon (O. kisutch) and Chinook salmon (O.
                tshawytscha) have been reported for the Corte Madera Creek
                watershed. These fish migrate from the ocean to spawn in the
                shallow headwater streams where they hatched, although Chinook
                salmon are probably strays from the Sacramento River. Coho
                salmon sightings in winter were quite common up to the 1970s,
                when degradation of its habitat ended spawning runs; in some
                years during the 1950s spawning fish were so plentiful on the
                then-Drake High School campus that students could gather them
                up. Unlike coho and Chinook salmon, steelhead survive spawning,
                returning immediately to the ocean, so are not often seen as
                adults. However, summer surveys of pools continue to record them
                in fair numbers, especially in upper San Anselmo and Cascade
                creeks in Fairfax.  <br /><br />

                Among the many consequences of urbanization that have diminished
                the steelhead run, the construction of the mile-long concrete
                channel in Ross and Kentfield was the most dramatic: in 1971,
                immediately after the channel’s completion, steelhead was still
                the dominant species by number in Ross, while surveys conducted
                in 1973–1975 showed that it had been relegated to a minor
                species. Steelhead is classified as a threatened species under
                the federal Endangered Species Act, and this status provides
                leverage for improving creek habitat in our watershed, to the
                benefit of all species. The last Coho was observed in 1982,
                about 10 years after completion of the U.S. Army Corps of
                Engineers flood control project. (Some members of the species O.
                mykiss, the same species as steelhead, spend their entire lives
                in freshwater, in which case they are called rainbow trout.)
