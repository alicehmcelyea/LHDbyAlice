                Erosion in both the uplands and in the creeks of our watershed
                has many repercussions, including flooding, loss of natural
                habitat, and threats to homes. What follows is a summary of the
                Geomorphic Assessment of the Corte Madera Creek Watershed,
                prepared by Matt Smeltzer, James Reilly, and David Dawdy, a
                study commissioned by Friends and published in 2000 (add link).

                <br /><br />

                Sand and gravel deposition downstream from Ross suggests that
                Corte Madera Creek has an unusually high sediment yield.
                Widening channels and bank failures also contribute to the
                perception that erosion adds significantly to this yield. These
                deposits reduce flood control effectiveness in the channel. This
                study estimates bedload sediment at Ross and investigates
                whether the sediment load is unnaturally high.

                Sediment Sources in the Watershed
              </h3>
              <p class="bc-small">
                This study’s sediment budget estimated that channel bed and bank
                erosion in the watershed’s alluvial channel network generated
                about 9 percent of the total bedload sediment load at Ross, for
                1976–1999. Fluvial transport from upland channel networks
                generated about 91 percent of the total sediment yield at Ross.
                This 91:9 ratio of upland/channel bank sediment sources is
                comparable to results of detailed sediment budgets compiled for
                other Marin County watersheds. 
                <br /><br />

                Total elimination of bank erosion and systemic channel widening
                throughout the alluvial channel network would probably reduce
                bedload sediment delivery to Ross by as much as about 430
                tons/yr, only 6 percent of the total bedload delivered to Ross.
                Total elimination of the additional sediment supply by dealing
                with problem sediment sources and improved hillslope management
                practices would probably reduce bedload sediment delivered to
                Ross by as much as about 1,600 tons/yr, or about 20% of the
                annual bedload inflow. 

                <br /><br />

                This study indicates that the San Anselmo Creek and Sleepy
                Hollow Creek subwatersheds  contribute about 29 percent and 26
                percent, respectively, of the total bedload sediment inflow at
                Ross.

                This study also evaluated the present state and trajectory of
                the channel’s natural geomorphic recovery from recent channel
                entrenchment. Corte Madera Creek’s alluvial channel network
                became moderately to deeply entrenched in the Holocene valley
                fill in about 1850–1910, abandoning its floodplain. Rapid
                channel entrenchment was evidently in partial response to
                logging and increasing livestock grazing intensity from the
                middle to late 1800s, coinciding with a period of somewhat
                greater than normal precipitation. After about 1910, numerous
                natural bedrock and human structures, like culverts and small
                dams to create ponds, outcropped in the channel bed; these
                slowed the channel incision rate and accelerated channel
                widening. Natural geomorphic recovery processes that restore
                aquatic and riparian habitat lost during channel entrenchment
                are operating in the Corte Madera Creek watershed, including
                progressive upstream channel aggradation in the lower portion of
                the mainstem Corte Madera Creek and, in the middle and upper
                portions of the alluvial channel network, channel bed level
                stabilization, channel widening, inset floodplain formation, and
                pool-riffle development.  
                <br /><br />
                Although progressive upstream channel aggradation evidently
                ceased in about 1964, constraints imposed by urbanization of the
                pre-entrenchment floodplain limit the rate of natural habitat
                improvement both by preventing channel widening with bank
                protection and flood control structures, and routing storm water
                directly into the channel network from impermeable surfaces.  
                <br /><br />
                As a priority, projects intended to improve flood control and/or
                aquatic and riparian habitat, habitat-supporting processes, and
                flood control should seek opportunities to increase active
                channel width rather than strictly prevent bed incision or bank
                retreat. Implementing site stormwater retention/drainage best
                management practices (referred to as Low Impact Development, or
                LID) that would increase alluvial groundwater storage and summer
                low flow discharges in the watershed would be beneficial
                salmonid habitat. LID also improves water quality in the
                creeks.
