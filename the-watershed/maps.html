                Although our watershed is named for Corte Madera Creek, which
                connects to San Francisco Bay, there are several important named

                watershed features map shows some important features: barriers
                to fish passage, some notable redwood groves, and the locations
                of our habitat e projects. Broad categories of imperviousness
                are shown on the Ross-Valley-imperviousness-map.

              <p>
                A relief map of Corte Madera Creek watershed showing how the
                area looked about 150 years ago provides a view from on high.
                This relief map, expertly made and painted by Dewey Livingstone,
                through the generosity of Glenda Griffith, gives one a birds’
                eye view of what the Ross Valley looked like before it was built
                out. In place of the familiar scenes of houses and shops, roads
                and parking lots, this model takes us back to the relatively
                natural valley. Where houses now stand beside the confined
                creek, you can see the original wetlands, home not to humans but
                to wild creatures of every kind: birds, fish, otters, and
                anything that wriggles in the fertile mud. The creek itself
                meanders lazily in a wider, shallower bed, with room to spread
                out during high winter flows, but with tree-shaded, snag-rich
                summer pools sustaining populations of fish now vanished,
                sacrificed to not-very-successful efforts to eliminate winter
                floods in the strait jacketed stream we know today. Looking at
                the way Nature let the creek flow in the past is not just a
                nostalgia trip. Seeing how the various components of the natural
                world developed and co-existed comfortably can give us some
                suggestions for the future. We can see how the landscape shapes
                the present Corte Madera Creek as it runs through the watershed
                and better understand the forces shaping the creek. Studying how
                the creek used to be can help us find better ways for the creek
                and all its neighbors—humans, plants and animals—to live
                together in harmony.    <br /><br />
                This beautiful and evocative model of Corte Madera Creek
                watershed is currently stored at the College of Marin Science
                Museum. The map can be hung on the wall or placed in a case. If
                wall-hung, the map has a horizontal orientation, 62 inches wide
                by 36 inches high; the relief sculpting protrudes about 10
                inches from the wall. The map weighs about the same as a framed
                painting, so two large picture hooks will support it. To visit
                it or arrange to display it in a classroom or at a meeting,
                contact Sandy Guldman, info@friendsofcortemaderacreek.org or
                415-456-5052.
