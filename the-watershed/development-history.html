                “A tract of park-like land, shaded by ancient trees with a
                sparkling stream running through it” was how Dr. Taliaferro
                described Ross Valley in 1849. The Coast Miwok practice of
                burning grasslands, and subsequent Mexican cattle ranching, had
                suppressed the growth of shrubs under the large oaks of the
                valley floor and created the scene he encountered. Soon, logging
                and increasingly intensive livestock grazing made their mark.
                Redwood and Douglas-fir forests were clear-cut for lumber; oak
                woodland was harvested for firewood and tan bark; intervening
                grassland was grazed or cut for hay; and brickworks operated at
                Larkspur and on the San Quentin peninsula. The bulk of the
                produce was shipped to San Francisco, via Larkspur and Ross
                Landing in today’s Kentfield.   <br /><br />

                By 1900 small communities were forming the nuclei of Corte
                Madera, Larkspur, San Anselmo, and Fairfax, served by a railroad
                from Sausalito, and the valley was dotted with grand landscaped
                estates. The population grew slowly until the opening of the
                Golden Gate Bridge in 1937; growth accelerated in the post-World
                War II housing boom, and by the 1950s the last dairies in Sleepy
                Hollow and in the Sorich Creek basin had been closed. The lower
                reaches of the watershed have mostly been developed; parts of
                the remaining areas have been set aside as parks and nature
                reserves. Intermediate elevations are characterized by
                low-density residential development. The upper reaches of the
                watershed are dedicated to recreation and domestic local water
                supply. The areas where large development projects can occur are
                very few, but in-fill development and redevelopment of existing
                residential and urban areas is continual.
