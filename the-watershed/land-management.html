              <p class="bc-small">
                Land use falls into five broad categories:  
              </p>
              <h4>Suburban Development</h4>
              <p>
                Private property is under the jurisdiction of the incorporated
                communities of Corte Madera, Fairfax, Larkspur, Ross, and San
                Anselmo or the County of Marin.  
              </p>
              <h4>Urban Development</h4>
              <p>
                This is a mixture of private and public property and includes
                residential and commercial uses.  
              </p>
              <h4>Open Space or Resource Protection</h4>
              <p>
                Marin Water manages a significant part of the upper reaches of
                the southern and western sides of the watershed. All or part of
                eight Open Space Preserves managed by the Marin County Open
                Space District are in the watershed; these areas are also in the
                upper reaches of the watershed. Sorich Ranch Park is managed by
                the Town of San Anselmo. A small part of Mount Tamalpais State
                Park is within the watershed. The California Department of Fish
                and Wildlife manages the Corte Madera Ecological Reserve,
                located south of the Ferry Terminal along San Francisco Bay.  
              </p>
              <h4>Developed Parks </h4>
              <p>
                Creekside Park, including the multi-use path along the creek, is
                a county park located in Kentfield; the path follows the creek
                from the Ferry Terminal upstream into the Town of Ross. Deer
                Park in Fairfax is also a county park is managed by Marin Water.
                Local communities maintain several parks within the watershed,
                nearly all of which are along creeks: Peri Park in Fairfax;
                Faude, San Anselmo Memorial, Creek, and Robson-Harrington parks
                in San Anselmo; Natalie Coffin Greene Park, Frederick Allen
                Park, and Ross Common in Ross; Piper, Dolliver, Magnolia,
                Hamilton, Bon Air Landing, Niven, and Remillard parks in
                Larkspur; and Town, San Clemente, and Granada parks in Corte
                Madera.  
              </p>
              <h4>Schools</h4>
              <p>
                Three high schools and numerous middle schools and elementary
                schools are near streams. Corte Madera Creek passes through the
                College of Marin Kentfield campus.

              <h3 class="content-block" id="regulatory-authority">
                Regulatory Authority
              </h3>
              <p class="bc-small">
                Regulatory authority for biological resources is held by the
                California Department of Fish and Wildlife and three federal
                agencies: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Fish and Wildlife
                Service, and NOAA Fisheries. Agencies dealing with water
                resources include the Environmental Protection Agency,
                California Environmental Protection Agency, and California Water
                Resources Control Board (both the Division of Water Rights and
                the Regional Water Quality Control Board). Some kinds of
                activities may involve the San Francisco Bay Conservation and
                Development Commission and/or the State Lands Commission. The
                State Department of Water Resources Division of Dam Safety has
                jurisdiction over repairs or changes to the dam at Phoenix
                Lake.  
                <br /><br />
                Regulations that apply state-wide and that are implemented by
                state and federal agencies include the Clean Water Act, the
                federal Endangered Species Act, the California Endangered
                Species Act, and the California Native Plant Protection Act.
                Marin County, each of the incorporated communities, and
                Special Districts within the watershed have some planning and
                land use tools that can be used to protect the integrity of the
                watershed. They may include such things as setbacks for
                development along drainages, policies for the protection of
                large trees, or other measures implemented at the discretion of
                local jurisdictions.  
                <br /><br />
                Jurisdictions with land use and planning authority within the
                watershed include the State of California, Marin County, and the
                incorporated communities of Corte Madera, Fairfax, Larkspur,
                Ross, and San Anselmo. Some of the Special Districts with
                planning authority in the Watershed include the Marin Water,
                Marin County Parks, Marin County Water Conservation and Flood
                Control District, and the Golden Gate Bridge, Highway and
                Transportation District.

              <h3 class="content-block" id="urbanization-issues">
                Urbanization Issues
              </h3>
              <p class="bc-small">
                Urbanization not only affects habitat in obvious ways—for
                example, direct loss of habitat, channelization of streams,
                degradation of water quality, and dewatering of streams—but it
                can also affect habitat in more subtle ways by altering and
                disrupting ecosystem processes that can have unintended impacts
                to aquatic ecosystems through increased flooding, channel
                erosion, landslides, and aquatic habitat destruction. It is
                impossible to separate the overlapping and interrelated impacts
                of urbanization; however, the following broad categories are
                used to provide more detail. Friends of Corte Madera Creek
                Watershed addresses all of these issues in its work. 
              </p>
              <h4>Alteration of Natural Vegetation</h4>
              <p>
                Urbanization causes severe and permanent alteration of the
                natural vegetation when the vegetation is removed or converted
                to buildings, pavement, lawns, and ornamental plants. In upland
                areas urbanization contributes to erosion and altered drainage,
                often reducing infiltration and increasing surface runoff.
                Impacts are particularly severe in riparian corridors, that
                under natural conditions are extremely rich in wildlife.
                Vegetation is commonly removed to increase the visibility of and
                access to streams and to allow the installation of landscaping
                and structures near the tops of stream banks. Loss of riparian
                vegetation reduces inputs of beneficial nutrients, recruitment
                of large woody debris, and stream-bank stability and increases
                the input of sediment and other pollutants in runoff by reducing
                the filtering effect of vegetation. It also leads to an increase
                in stream temperature by removing much of the overhead canopy.
                In spite of these impacts, what remains of our creek corridors
                constitutes a refuge for native trees and wildlife on the valley
                floor.  
              </p>
              <h4>
                Disrupted Hydrological Processes and Reduced Stream Complexity
              </h4>
              <p>
                Construction and landscaping near streams are often followed by
                the installation of retaining walls and other hard structures
                intended to protect or enlarge developed areas. In downtown San
                Anselmo, buildings hang over San Anselmo Creek and foundations
                rest on the creek bed. The course of Fairfax Creek was changed
                and it was buried in a culvert, apparently to provide more
                buildable area near the center of town. This results in severely
                constricted streams with disrupted or altered hydrological and
                riparian processes. Furthermore, in developed areas, much of the
                surface soil is covered by impervious surfaces (buildings,
                parking lots, roads), which increase peak flows and change
                channel characteristics. These changes increase the maximum
                discharge associated with floods and increase the frequency of
                flooding.   <br /><br />
                San Anselmo Creek, like many degraded urban streams, has a
                relatively uniform bed, with few pools or riffles, exposed
                near-vertical banks down-cut by several yards, chronic high
                sediment loads, is deficient in woody debris, and has severely
                reduced numbers of aquatic organisms compared to nearby
                undeveloped streams.  
                <br /><br />
                Clearing of vegetation, compaction of soil, installation of
                roads and other impervious surfaces, and direct interception of
                subsurface flows by drains damage watershed hydrology.
                Impervious areas increase winter peak flow and block
                infiltration into the soil. This results in a reduced
                groundwater storage and lower summer base flows.
              </p>
              <h4>Impaired Water Quality</h4>
              <p>
                Urban non-point source pollution includes heavy metals,
                pesticides, bacteria, organics (oil and grease), dirt, and
                nutrients. In urbanized streams, the type and quantity of
                nutrients can change significantly. The important function of
                large woody debris and leafy detritus in providing nutrients in
                natural streams is taken over by excessive nutrient loading from
                sewage and runoff from roads and landscaped areas. The principal
                effect of excess nutrients upon a stream is the stimulation of
                algae and other aquatic plant growth, such as can be seen in the
                lower reaches of Corte Madera Creek during the spring and
                summer. Water quality testing in our watershed shows high
                concentrations of E. coli in some locations, especially in the
                summer. In tidal reaches, Enteroccocus concentrations do not
                meet the standard for water contact recreation. The San
                Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board has listed
                Corte Madera Creek as impaired because of high diazinon
                levels.   <br /><br />
                In 1999, fish biologist Alice Rich placed thermographs at
                several locations in the creek. During the monitoring, which
                took place between March and September, she observed elevated
                temperatures throughout the watershed. The warmest water, which
                became lethal to young steelhead, was in the upstream end of the
                concrete flood control channel. Sleepy Hollow Creek had water
                temperatures during the summer that were generally satisfactory
                in shaded pools. Several habitat changes caused by urbanization
                can affect stream temperatures. Loss of riparian vegetation and
                increased channel width increase the area of unshaded stream
                surface area, and reduced water depths further contribute to
                heat loss or gain, increasing diurnal temperature fluctuations.
                Stream temperatures in urban areas may also be indirectly
                affected by changes in hydrology, channel morphology, and
                microclimate. Lower summer base flows resulting from reduced
                infiltration can also contribute to higher water temperatures.  
              </p>
              <h4>Barriers to Fish Passage</h4>
              <p>
                Urban development is characterized by high road densities, and
                the resulting bridges, culverts, and other structures constrain
                channels and impede fish migration in a variety of ways. The
                most significant barrier to passage for fish in our watershed is
                the concrete flood control channel in Kentfield and Ross. It is
                a velocity barrier for spawning steelhead at high flows because
                the resting pools are inadequate and it is a thermal barrier to
                smolts as they swim to the ocean. Other barriers include a very
                long culvert under downtown Fairfax and various poorly designed
                fish ladders, weirs, and small dams throughout the watershed.
                Areas of high temperature and poor water quality can also
                present barriers to passage.  
              </p>
              <h4>Degraded Biological Diversity and Habitat Suitability</h4>
              <p>
                The abundance and diversity of aquatic organisms are greatly
                altered by urban impacts. The key to protecting and restoring
                urban streams appears to be reducing the imperviousness of
                surfaces associated with urban development and protecting
                channel integrity and riparian vegetation. It has been observed
                that stream quality impairment is first observed when watershed
                imperviousness reaches 15% of the total watershed and becomes
                severe at 30%. For stream ecosystems containing self-sustaining
                steelhead populations, some experts recommend that watershed
                imperviousness should not exceed 10%. At this level, creek flows
                are not radically changed, and minor pollutants can be filtered
                out by vegetation and soil. Reducing the amount of runoff and
                minimizing landscape disturbance also can reduce urban impacts
                to habitat quality.
